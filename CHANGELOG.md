# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Transposer public API explicitly exposed (was public but inaccessible due to module shadowing).

### Fixed
- Removed placeholder `public enum MusicCraftCore` that shadowed module name and prevented qualified type access (e.g., `MusicCraftCore.Transposer`).

### Changed
- Version constant moved from type member to module-level public constant `musicCraftCoreVersion` to avoid shadowing the module name.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- MusicTheory subsystem with core primitives: NoteName, ChordQuality, Chord, Note, MusicalKey
- Note frequency/MIDI conversion utilities (MusicTheory enum)
- Diatonic spelling and chord generation: LetterName, Accidental, SpelledNote, DiatonicChordGenerator, RelatedKeys
- Chord parsing: Chord.init?(parsing:) for parsing chord name strings (e.g., "Am7", "F♯", "B♭dim")
- Transposition utilities: Transposer enum for Roman numeral transposition
- Music theory reference data: music_theory.json with scales, intervals, chord formulas, circle of fifths, progressions, key detection rules
- TheoryReference struct with load() and shared lazy-loaded instance for bundled JSON data
- Comprehensive test suite for all music theory types

### Known Limitations
- Transposer uses fixed sharp/flat spelling (C♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, D♭, E♭, A♭, B♭); user-preference enharmonic rendering is a future enhancement.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Swift Package skeleton with Package.swift manifest
- Subsystem directory structure (Audio, DSP, ChordDetection, MusicTheory, AnalysisPipeline, Resources)
- Test target with baseline test
- README with project overview and usage documentation
